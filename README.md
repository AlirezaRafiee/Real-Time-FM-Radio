# Real-time-FM-Radio
This project includes three phases \\
The First Phase of this project is getting familiar with dangle, receiving signals, and transferring them to baseband signals, specifying whether an input frequency is an FM carrier or not
The Second Phase of this project is getting radio channels and playing them using dangle signals, four methods are used for this purpose {using the angle of the received signal, using the envelope of the received signal (using Hilbert), zero crossing, built-in functions in Matlab }
The Last Phase is to develop a GUI with Matlab for the Real-time Radio
